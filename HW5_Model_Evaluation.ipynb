    "If you recall from a lecture some time back, it was shown that another way of improving the results of classification is to perform some form of sampling to balance the number of samples there are for the various classes. The reason why this works for specific classifiers, and methods for doing the sampling, are numerious and we don't have enough time to cover all of them in this course.  However, it is still beneficial to know this works and that it is something that you should be considering when you are training models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, for this question, we will implement a very naive method for sampling so we can use the results for training our models again.  Below you will find a function stub, complete the function and have it return a copy of the input dataframe where each class (except for the smallest one) have been undersampled to match the size of the smallest class in the dataset. In this function you should assume the `lab` column is the class label and not the dicotomized binary classification converted label.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this you may want to use the [groupby](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) function of the DataFrame to get groups of rows from your DataFrame.  You may also wish to use the [sample](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sample.html) function to select a number of rows from a group. You can also use the [apply](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html) method to process each group from your grouped rows. These are just hints, you can solve the problem how you see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this function is complete, apply it to each of your training datasets that have been constructed with different feature selection methods from partition 1 (the ones with all the NF, C, .., X labels). You will not be applying this to your testing sets. After you have your sampled feature selected datasets, you will then apply your function that converts the multi-class problem to a binary problem to each of the resultant selected subsets so we can use these new undersampled data for the next several questions.\n",
